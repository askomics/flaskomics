Starting from release 4.3.0, a CLI is available with the [askoclics](https://github.com/askomics/askoclics) python package.  
This CLI relies on the AskOmics **API Key**, found in your <navbar><i class="fa fa-cog"></i> Account management</navbar> tab.

The main goal of the CLI is to help automatize data upload and integration into an existing AskOmics instance.

Both the python package and the bash command line currently include the following features:

- File management (Upload, list, preview, integrate, delete)
- Dataset management (List and delete)
- Results management (List, preview results, download results, get sparql query, and delete)
- SPARQL management (Send SPARQL query)

This library is currently a work in progress.
