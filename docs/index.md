AskOmics is a visual SPARQL query interface supporting both intuitive data integration and querying while shielding the user from most of the technical difficulties underlying RDF and SPARQL.

AskOmics allows heterogeneous bioinformatics data (formatted as tabular files, GFF, BED or native RDF files) to be loaded into an RDF triplestore and then be transparently and interactively queried through a user-friendly interface.

AskoMics also support federated queries to external SPARQL endpoints.
